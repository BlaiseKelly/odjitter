Origin-destination (OD) datasets are ubiquitous for representing travel behavior in transport planning and modelling.
Despite emerging large data sources, OD data continues to play an established --- if not central --- role in transport research in the 21^st^ century, with recent applications ranging from analysis of the evolution of urban activity and shared mobility services over time [e.g. @shi_exploring_2019; @li_effects_2019] to inference of congestion and mode split [@bachir_inferring_2019; @gao_method_2021]. 
Perhaps in part because it is so well established, there has been little research in recent years on new methods for processing OD datasets to add value and insight, notwithstanding notable exceptions for OD dataset validation [@alexander_validation_2015], aggregation [@he_simple_2018; @liu_snn_2021] and disaggregation [@katranji_mobility_2016].

<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>. -->
