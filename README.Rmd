# Questions

Origin-destination (OD) datasets are ubiquitous, used by statistical and transport planning organisations to efficiently represent aggregate travel behavior worldwide.
Despite emerging 'big data' sources such as massive GPS datasets, OD data continues to play an established --- if not central --- role in transport research in the 21^st^ century.
Recent applications range from analysis of the evolution of urban activity and shared mobility services over time [e.g. @shi_exploring_2019; @li_effects_2019] to inference of congestion and mode split [@bachir_inferring_2019; @gao_method_2021].

<!-- Perhaps in part because they are so well established, comparatively few recent research papers have explored new methods for processing OD datasets. -->
Recent papers have presented new methods for OD dataset validation [@alexander_validation_2015], aggregation [@he_simple_2018; @liu_snn_2021] and disaggregation [@katranji_mobility_2016].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe and test methods for randomising origin and destination points and disaggregation on a real world example using reproducible analysis and open access data, a process we refer to as 'jittering'.

<!-- In this paper we outline such methods and their uses, demonstrating how jittering can be used to create more diffuse and accurate estimates of movement at the level of segments ('flows') on transport network, with minimal computational overheads compared with the computationally intensive process of route calculation ('routing') or processing large GPS datasets. -->
<!-- Long version of paper: -->
<!-- We do this by defining OD datasets, their uses, and other terms in relation to jittering, in Section \@ref(od); describing a real world case study, input datasets, and methods, in Section \@ref(methods); presenting the results of different jittering techniques in Section \@ref(findings); and discussing the potential uses of and next steps for the development of methods to add value to OD datasets for sustainable transport planning in section \@ref(discussion). -->
<!-- Short version of paper: -->
<!-- We do this by defining OD datasets, their uses, and other terms in relation to jittering, in this introduction; outlining the research question with reference to a real world case study of modelling cycling networks in Edinburgh, in Section \@ref(q); describing the results in Section \@ref(methods); and presenting the results of different jittering techniques in Section \@ref(findings). -->

<!-- # Origin-destination data {#od} -->

<!-- First, a description of the utility of OD data in contemporary policy contexts, and definitions, are in order. -->

<!-- An example of the utility of OD data, and the utility of open access (anonymised and aggregtated) OD data in particular, is Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), first launched nationally across England in 2017 [@lovelace_propensity_2017]. -->
<!-- The PCT provides a strong and consistent evidence-base that local authorities across England and Wales are using to inform strategic Local Cycling and Walking Plans. -->
<!-- Based on OD data --- initially for commuting trips only but subsequently also based on travel to school data [@goodman_scenarios_2019] --- the tool visualises cycling potential at zone, desire line, route and route network levels, and is being used by government, consultancy and public/advocacy stakeholders nationwide [@lovelace_open_2020]. -->
<!-- The PCT makes open OD data 'come to life' by converting a 'haystack' of data into meaningful insights into currently cycling levels and future potential, highlighting the need to invest in cohesive networks of cycling interventions, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:haystack). -->

```{r haystack, fig.cap="Illustration of how geographic visualisation and routing can add value to OD datasets and make them more policy relevant."}
# todo: update this if needed, commented out to save space and cut to the chase!
# knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/142071229-81358e26-5e8d-437e-9ef8-91704a4e690f.png")
```


<!-- The PCT is available for use by local authorities, consultancies, cycling advocacy groups, academic researchers and members of the public. -->
<!-- Subsequent work building on the tool has been used to prioritise investment in active transport in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic [@lovelace_methods_2020]. -->
<!-- Comparable tools have yet to be developed and deployed publicly in most other countries. -->
<!-- With the exception of regionally specific models using software such as sDNA [@cooper_using_2017] (the results of which are usually not in the public domain) and bespoke city-specific models [@larsen_build_2013; @zhang_prioritizing_2014], there are few large scale tools using OD data that are free for public use that we are aware of. -->

<!-- In this context, this paper outlines methods to add further value to OD data through processes of disaggregating OD data and 'jittering' to increase the density of route networks arising from the conversion of OD data into route network outputs of the kind illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:haystack). -->

The following question motivated the development of the jittering approach presented in this paper:

> How can OD data representing trips between large geographic zones be used more effectively, to generate results at the level of segments representing route networks of current or potential flow to inform local interventions?

Our hypothesis was that pre-processing OD data using methods described in this paper would lead to more effective use of OD data in transport planning.
Before describing the approach to answer this question, some definitions are in order:

<!-- , it is worth briefly defining OD data: datasets that consist of: -->
- **Origins**: information the departure for trips, in this context IDs associated with zones of departure
- **Destinations**: IDs representing the destination of trips
- **Attributes**: typically the number of trips made between each 'OD pair', sometimes by mode and with additional attributes such as the Euclidean and route distance between the each OD pair
- **Jittering**: The combined process of 'splitting' OD pairs representing many trips into multiple 'sub OD' pairs (disaggregation) and assigning origins and destinations to multiple unique points within each zone

# Methods {#methods}

Beyond the zone data illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:izs), the input dataset consisted of open access OD data from the 2011 census.
The OD data can be represented as both tabular and, when start and end points are assigned to centroids within each zone, as geographic entities, as illustrated in a sample of three OD pairs presented in Figure \@ref(fig:od).
<!-- , which presents data at the zone and OD level for the top 3 OD pairs by number of interzonal travel between zones by all modes in Edinburgh in tabular and visual form. -->
<!-- The zone boundaries are based on open boundary data provided by data.gov.uk at the Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) level. -->
<!-- The population was 480,139 in the 2011 Census, 237,839 of whom were employed. -->
<!-- In the 2011 Census, 4.3% of residents of the area reported cycling to work, ranging from 1% in Intermediate Zone (IZ) Ferniehill, South Moredun and Craigour to 10% in the IZ Marchmont West. -->

## Sampling origin and destination points

<!-- ## Random sampling of origin and destination points -->
Key to jittering is ensuring that each trip starts and ends in a different place.
To do this, there must be 'sub-points' within each zone, one for each trip originating and departing.

The simplest approach is simple random spatial sampling, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:jitters) (B).
This involves generating random coordinate pairs, testing to check if the point is contained withing the boundary of each zone from which points are required, and repeating the process until enough randomly located points have been created.
This approach has the advantages of simplicity, requiring no additional datasets, but has the disadvantage of that it may lead to unrealistic start and end points, e.g. with trips being simulated to start in rivers and in uninhabited wilderness areas.

<!-- ## Sampling origin and destination points from the transport network -->
To overcome the limitations of the simple random sampling approach, the universe of possible coordinates from which trips can originate and end can be reduced by providing another geographic input dataset.
This dataset could contain known trip attractors such as city centers and work places, as well as tightly defined residential 'subzones'.
For highly disaggregated flows in cases where accurate building datasets are available, building footprints could also be used.
Perhaps the most useful input for subsampling, however, is a transport road network, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:jitters) (C): transport network datasets are readily available in most places and ensure that all trips happen on the network, an advantage when using some routing services.

## Disaggregation

Both of the jittering techniques outlined above generate more diffuse route networks.
However, a problem with OD datasets is that they are often highly variable: one OD pair could represent 1 trip, while another could represent 1000 trips.
To overcome this problem a process of disaggregation can be used, resulting in additional OD pairs within each pair of zones. 
The results of disaggregation are illustrated geographically in Figure \@ref(fig:jitters) (D) and in terms of changes to attributes, in Tables \@ref(tab:dis1) and \@ref(tab:dis2).
As shown in those tables, updated attributes can be calculated by dividing previous trip counts by the number of OD pairs in the disaggregated representation of the data, 3 in this case.
To determine how many disaggregated OD pairs each original OD pair is split into, a maximum threshold was set: an OD pairs with a total trip count exceeding this threshold (set at 150 in this case) is split into the minimum number of disaggregated OD pairs that reduce the total number of trips below the threshold.

```{r}
od_to_disag = odsf_top3 %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  slice(1) %>%
  transmute(representation = "original", geo_code1, geo_code2, all, foot)
od_disaggregated = od_top3_disaggregated %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>% 
  filter(o_agg == od_to_disag$geo_code1) %>% 
  filter(d_agg == od_to_disag$geo_code2) %>% 
  transmute(representation = "disaggregated", geo_code1 = o_agg, geo_code2 = d_agg, all, foot)
```

```{r dis}
knitr::kable(od_to_disag, caption = "Attribute data associated with an OD pair before disaggregation.")
```

```{r dis2}
knitr::kable(od_disaggregated, caption = "Attribute data associated with an OD pair after disaggregation.")
```

We refer to the combined process of sampling origin and destination points --- either using simple random geographic sampling, sampling from the transport network, or other sampling technique --- and disagreggation as jittering. 


# Findings

We found that re-sampling origin and start points during the conversion of tabular OD datasets to their representation as geographic 'desire lines' can be undertaken in a variety of ways, including simple random sampling, sampling nodes on transport networks and simulating origin and destination points in polygons representing building.
Building on the established practice of jittering in data visualisation [ref], we label this group of techniques 'origin-destination jittering', which includes the vital 'disaggregation' step to ensure a diffuse network.

The results of applying each of these jittering techniques to an OD dataset representing travel to work in Edinburgh are illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:rneted).
The results demonstrate that OD jittering led to substantially more dense and presumably more realistic route networks.
In future work we aim to evaluate the extent to which route networks that are derived from jittered datasets are better, with reference to comparisons between observed travel behavior on transport networks including from manual and automatic counters at point locations and other sources of data.

```{r rneted, fig.cap="Route network results derived from non-jittered OD data (left) and OD data that had been jittered, with pre-processing steps including disaggregation of large flows and randomisation of origin and destionation points on the transport network (right)."}
